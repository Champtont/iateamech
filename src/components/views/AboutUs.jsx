        Today, The business world is one with the Internet. This means that all
        businesses, no matter the size, have to move in this direction or face
        the possibility of being forgotten, or even parish. Simply put, your
        customers, your clients, your people... are unable to find you without
        the help of the internet. Large companies have the means to employ tons
        of computer scientists, data analysts, full-stack, frontend, and backend
        developers... but small business is often left in the dust. This is
        where IAteAMech comes into play. Founded in 2021, we wanted to create a
        solution to keep small business competitive. IAteAMech is a company that
        provides quality and affordability, while keeping our clients vision and
